**Post idea that occurred to me while out about about:** As a Super User/ Site Owner, I can post a creative idea that occurs to me that is within a specified amount of maximum characters. This will be made instantly available to all of the site users that I have allowed into my feedback group on the FootNote app

**View post list:** As a Site User I can view the latest idea posted by the SuperUser(owner of the page I am viewing)-as long as I have been accepted into their feedback group)
Vote on idea: As a Site User-I can vote green or red on the SuperUser's idea. A green vote means that, in my opinion, the idea is worth pursuing and a red vote means, in my opinion, the idea is not worth pursuing further. Only those who voted green will be presented with the option to post a footnote as the site is interested in constructive criticism and offerings and would like to avoid overly negative, unnecessary comments

**Post a footnote:** If I vote green, I am presented with an additional option to post a FootNote about the idea (with a maximum length of forty words) As a Site User I can post a 'FootNote' about the idea shared by the Superuser/site owner that comments on the idea they have shared in a concise way

**View votes** (Green vote to pursue idea, red vote not to pursue idea): As a Superuser / Admin I can view the amount of green votes/red votes on each idea so that I can see whether the people I have allowed into the feedback group are in favour of keeping the idea or not

**View footnotes:** As a Superuser / Admin I can view the FootNotes left by green voters (only green voters will have the ability to leave footnotes). These footnotes will provide me with instant, concise feedback on my original idea so that I can get an insights into why they believe that I should pursue the idea and potentially be presented with different directions to take 

**Account registration:** As a Site User I can register an account so that I can create my own profile to post my own original ideas and get footnote feedback from other app users that I have accepted to be members of my feedback group. I can also apply to become a member of feedback groups of profiles of others app users so that I can vote and leave footnote feedback comments on their original ideas. I know that once my account is registered, my engagement will be monitored and, because of the full transparency policy on the app, other users will be able to view my engagement statistics if i apply to be a feedback member on their profile

**Feedback Group Membership:** As a Site User I can apply to become a feedback member of a profile on the FootNote App. As part of my application, I understand that the SuperUser/Admin of the profile I am applying to will be able to access my statistics (my green/red votes to date and what level of engagement I have had on the apps-e.g. the numbers of original ideas that I have posted to my own profile and the amount of footnotes I have deposited on other profiles)

**Comment on a post:** As a Site User I can leave comments on a post so that I can be involved in the conversation

**Accept/Reject applicants into my feedback groups:** As a Superuser/Admin, I can view the profiles/statistics of people who have expressed interest in joining my feedback group to gauge whether or not I will accept them. Their profile will inform me about how many original ideas they have posted to their own profile (without telling me what the ideas were) and how much feedback they offer(the number of footnotes that they have left on other profiles to date). As part of the transparent policy on the app also, I will be able to view the green vote/red vote ratio of all of their votes to date. This is important as if I allow them access my profile, they will be able to view my creative ideas, vote and leave footnotes which will be visible to everyone. I will be able to see if they have never posted an original idea of their own and have only posted red votes with no footnotes, in which case, I will probably reject them

**Know about transparency policy/feedback group applications:** As a Site User, I know that other users will see my statistics and history of engagement with the app when I apply to join a feedback group.  This incentivises users to post their own original ideas and to offer footnote feedback on other people's ideas so that they will be allowed into different feedback groups

**Like / Unlike:** As a Site User I can like or unlike footnotes left by other members of the feedback group

**View footnotes:** As a site user, I can view other footnotes if I have posted a footnote myself

**Manage posts:** As a Site Admin I can create, read, update and delete both my original idea and the footnotes left on that idea so that I can manage what footnotes I store and when I want to remove my idea from the website and post a different idea. There is a policy on the app of having only one original idea at a time for each feedback group

**Store FootNotes:** As a Site Admin, I can choose to store some of the FootNotes posted by members of the feedback group to my personal profile, visible to only me so that I can have the feedback on file

**Approve comments:** As a Site Admin I can delete the original idea whenever I want to and the footnotes will be stored/deleted along with the ideas
