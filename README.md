Fomr what perspective can members use the app?: I intend to apply this from both a user perspective and a supersuer perspective.

The app from the perspective of the superuser who is also the administrator and, as such, a regulator of the site will be able to log in and regulate the front end view of their profile. They will operate as an administator and readily be able to control what views and posts appear on their page. it is via the administation also that the superuser will be able to decide whether they store FootNotes to their original idea in their private (hidden profile) so that they have they available when pursuing their idea at a later stage.

What is it?: The FootNote app is an app connecting creative people. It connects creative people whose art form is original writing of some sort, who want to share their original ideas and to get instant feedback from similarly minded people in useful footnote format, with a maximum amount of characters so that the contribution provided by other app users is a helpful nod as opposed to providing an idea to plagiarise. The emphasis on transparency, with the statistics of members becoming visible to the owners of profiles that they apply to give feedback on is in place to ensure that nobody abuses the app or tries to use it as a method of stealing the original thoughts of others/to offer unconstructive negative feedback.

 Similarly to the preferences section of Tinder, upon joining the app, the FootNote member is presented with several questions, encouraging them to stipulate their area of interest, the genres they are interested in and writers they are similar to/inspired by and their form of writing (novel/songwriter/screenwriter/poet). Based on the preferences that they list, they will unlock a pool of other profiles that they can apply to be feedback givers on. The owners of the profiles they apply to be feedback givers to, will be able to see their site statistics (how much interaction they have had on the FootNote application (e.g. what ratio of green/red votes on other people's original ideas they have had, how many FootNotes they have posted as feedback to other people's profiles, how many original ideas have they posted to their own profile, when did they join the site etc.) The owner of the profile, who decides whether or not to accept the applicant as a feedback-giver on their own profile will be able to make an informed decision about whether to accept them or not based on their statistics. (e.g. if a profile owners sees that the member who has applied to be a feedback giver on their page, joined three years ago and has yet to post their own original thought and has voted 100% red on other people's original ideas without providing any Footnotes, the profile owner may not be inclined to accept them to their profile as the impression created is that they are there to steal ideas, to offer exclusively negative feedback and not to contribute anything themselves).

Everyone who joins the FootNote app has the choice of having their own FootNote profile, where they post their ideas and are susceptible to criticism/feedback by the other FootNote app members who they have accepted as feedback givers on their profile. Additionally, they will be capable of applying to be a feedback given on the profiles or other writers who they match with. They will need to be accepted as a feedback giver before they can see the ideas, vote the idea green/red and give feedback on the profiles of other FootNote members.
